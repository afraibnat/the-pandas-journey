# the-pandas-journey

Created for the Girls Who Code 2023 Summer Immersion Program
"The Pandas Journey" is a mini-game application designed with the intent of elevating children's mental health following the Game Jam prompt "What does hope mean to you?" to reflect the message of giving back with gratitude for supportive communities and striving for positive outcomes despite challenges.
